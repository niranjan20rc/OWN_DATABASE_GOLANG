Got it—you want to take **user input in VS Code using Go (Golang)**.

Here’s a simple way using **fmt.Scanln** or **bufio** depending on the need:

---

### 1. Using `fmt.Scanln` (Basic Input)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var name string
	fmt.Print("Enter your name: ")
	fmt.Scanln(&name) // takes input until the first space or newline
	fmt.Println("Hello,", name)
}
```

**How it works:**

* `fmt.Scanln(&name)` reads user input and stores it in the variable `name`.
* The `&` symbol passes the memory address of `name` so the value can be stored there.

---

### 2. Using `bufio` (For Full Line Input)

If you want to read **full sentences** including spaces:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
	fmt.Print("Enter your full name: ")
	name, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
	fmt.Println("Hello,", name)
}
```

**Why use this:**

* `ReadString('\n')` reads input until the user presses **Enter**, capturing everything including spaces.

---

### 3. Taking Integer Input

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var age int
	fmt.Print("Enter your age: ")
	fmt.Scanln(&age)
	fmt.Println("You are", age, "years old")
}
```

---

### How to Run in VS Code:

1. Open the terminal in VS Code.
2. Navigate to your Go file directory.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   go run filename.go
   ```
4. Enter input when prompted.

If you want, I can give you a **single program** that takes **multiple inputs (string, int)** in one go.
Do you want me to make that for you?
